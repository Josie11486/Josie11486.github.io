        <p><b>Dec 7th, 2018</b></p>
        <p>Welcome to blog.jos! Let me tell you a little bit about how this website came to be...</p>

        <p>This blog is not powered by SquareSpace or Wordpress, I actually built it using HTML and CSS. I created this website as a final project for one of my web design classes, but it's become so much more than that.</p>

        <p>I have always been interested marketing and communication, and I knew that technology was an increasingly important part of that, but for years I avoided the alien language of coding at all costs. When I was in high school, my mom suggested that I join a Girls Who Code club, and I protested vehemently. Then as a freshman in college, I almost decided to take a coding cognate to fulfill my STEM requirement, but I chickened out and took geology (better known as “rocks for jocks”) instead. During my sophomore year, I signed up for a creative coding class, and then dropped the day before the first assignment was due.</p>

        <p>Finally, during the second semester of my sophomore year, I signed up for an introductory web design class, and it stuck. There was a harsh learning curve, but once I got used to the fussy syntax of computer languages, I started to really enjoy it. I was shocked and amazed and a bit disappointed that I had resisted it for so long.</p>

        <p>While my main interest is marketing strategy, I am really excited about adding programming and web design to my portfolio. Even though I'm still a beginnger, it has been really useful in my work to have an understanding of how things like websites, apps, and search engines function, and it's also a lot a lot of fun! Having a website allows me to explore my ideas, showcase my work, and share it all with the world. Right now I am in a class that requies a weekly blog post related to graphic design, which which you can read in the "Infographics" section. I also plan on posting my projects here as I build my portfolio, and occasionally writing about topics and ideas that interest me. Have fun exploring my site, and thanks for stopping by!</p>
