        <p>They say life is what happens while you’re busy making other plans.</p>

        <p>That is kind of how I fell into coding (and a lot of other things). This website is not powered by SquareSpace or Wordpress, I actually built it using HTML and CSS. I was always interested in the possibilities of digital marketing and web design, but for years I avoided the alien language of coding at all costs. When I was in high school, my mom suggested that I join a Girls Who Code club, and I protested vehemently. Then as a freshman in college, I almost decided to take a coding cognate to fulfill my STEM requirement, but I chickened out and took geology (better known as “rocks for jocks”) instead. During my sophomore year, I signed up for a creative coding class last minute, and then dropped the day before the first assignment was due.</p>

        <p>Finally, during the second semester of my sophomore year, I signed up for an introductory web design class, and it stuck. There was a harsh learning curve, but once I got used to the fussy syntax of HTML, I started to really enjoy it. I was shocked and amazed and a bit disappointed that I had resisted it for so long. It was never part of my plan… and then suddenly it was.</p>

        <p>I went into college thinking I would do something with marketing and communication in the music industry. I’ve always liked communication, and I figured music would be more fun than something like finance or insurance. I was busy picturing free concert tickets and office jam sessions and forgot that it’s still an actual job. What I have discovered is that it doesn’t really matter what industry you’re in, your day to day activities are still just work.</p>

        <p>As soon as I realized that I enjoy both the finished product and the effort that goes into creating a beautiful website, I changed my plan and never looked back.</p>

        <p>My most recent plan is to use this website to continue exploring my various interests and improving my coding skills. I also want it to serve as a professional yet personal representation of myself that I can share with friends, family and future employers. But most importantly, I want it to be a place where all my big ideas and little plans can exist outside of my head, so that I have the clarity to enjoy life as it happens.</p>
