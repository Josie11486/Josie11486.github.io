 <h2>My Take On This Class...</h2>
  <p> Making web pages is fun. I took a similar class last semester, and some of the information is overlapping, but there are a lot of new concepts as well. The professors have totally different teaching styles. I enjoyed the other class, but this class takes a <em>much better</em> approach for people who are totally new to the world coding and the related concepts, terms, etc. Even when we go over the same concepts, I feel like I learn a better or more detailed version in this class, its great! </p>

<h2>My Take On Lists...</h2>
  <p> For some reason I totally hate making lists, so I am not going to do that. I understand how to make them, I just don't enjoy it. I'm going to keep my listing to a minimum.</p>
