        <p><b>Dec 7th, 2018</b></p>
        <p>While I was making this website, I used the photo above as a placeholder because it matches my colors nicely, and I needed to get an idea of what the finished product would look like. Upon second glance I realized that I had stumbled upon the perfect metaphor: a work in progress. </p>

        <p>I am a 20 year old girl from Chicago studying Communications and Interactive Media at University of Miami, but that doesn’t really say much about me. People always try to define themselves and pin down a specific identity, but that seems unrealistic to me. We are always evolving, and I think that by trying to define ourselves, we are limiting ourselves. If you really want to know more about me, read my posts!<p>

<p>I’m here to share my interests, thoughts and work in hopes that it will help guide me through life, and maybe even land me a job. Enjoy!</p>
