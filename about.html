        <p><b>[02-18-2019]</b></p>

        <p>I’m a junior at University of Miami studying communications and interactive media. But most people don't really know what that means...</p>

        <p>Basically, most of my classes are related to how businesses communicate with consumers. I’m in the honors program, so I have the freedom to design my own major and pick which courses I want to take within in the school of communication. My main career interest is marketing strategy, so most of my classes have to do with advertising and branding. My minor, interactive media, focuses on the digital realm, so I am also taking classes like web design, user interaction, and app development. </p>

        <p>Outside of the classroom, I am involved in the Media Management Association, the Entrepreneurship Club, and a student run communication consultancy called Orange Umbrella. “OU” as we call it, is a really unique program where students essentially run a small advertising agency for credit. We have real, paying clients, campaigns, and deadlines! This semester, I am the director of the Strategy & PR. We do a lot of research on our clients, as well as their industry and target audience, and then use that information to figure out the best way to help them accomplish their goals. Once we have decided on a strategy, we discuss it with the client, and once its approved, we send it off to the creatives to make the final product. </p>

        <p>I love this kind of work because you get to think about what makes people tick, what they care bout, what motivates them… But the best part of the job is that we get to work with ideas. As Heather LeFevere (one of my personal heroes) said in her book Brain Surfing, “Lots of people have “strategist” or “strategic” in their title, but I’d bet money a good majority of them are 100 percent adults doing grown-up work in pleated slacks. I, on the other hand, have the ultimate Peter Pan type job where I get paid to play with ideas." Of course there is some "real" work involved, I spend a lot of time doing research, creating briefs, going to meetigns, etc, but when you're excited about an idea, working on it is fun. </p>

        <p>Outside the classroom, I like spending time with friends, traveling, and anything that has to do with the ocean. I have been scuba certified since I was 10 years old, I love paddle boarding, and this year and I am working on learning how to surf. I used to play club volleyball, and although I stopped after high school, I’m always down for an impromptu game on the beach. I also love making people laugh. I’m really not THAT funny, but I’d like to imagine that in another life I was an at least mediocre stand up comedian. Or maybe I just spend too much time looking at memes and watching the The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Either way, I hope you enjoy what I have to say, and thank you for reading my blog! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, want to hire me, or if you simply want to discuss great ideas. </p>
